Sorting Algorithms
Name                         Effect

sort()                       Sort all elements

stable_sort()                Sorts while preserving order of equal elements

partitial_sort()             Sorts until the first n elements are correct

partitial_sort_copy()        Copies elements in sorted order

nth_element()                Sorts according n-th position

make_heap()                  Converts a range into a heap

push_heap()                  Adds an element to a heap

pop_heap()                   Removes an element from a heap

sort_heap()                  Sorts the heap(it is no longer a heap after the call)

is_sorted()                  Returns whether elements in a range are sorted

is_sorted_until()            Returns first unsorted element in a range

is_partitioned()             Returns whether the elements in a range are partitioned in two groups according a criterion

partition_point()            Returns the partitioning element for a range partitioned into elements fulfilling and elements not fulfilling a predicate

is_heap()                    Returns whether elements in a range are sorted as heap

is_heap_until()              Returns first element in a range not sorted as heap

partition()                  Changes the order of the elements so that elements that match a criterion are at the front

stable_partition()           Same as partition() but preserves the relative order of matching and non matching elements

partition_copy()             Copies the elements while changing the order so that elements that matching a criterion are at the front
