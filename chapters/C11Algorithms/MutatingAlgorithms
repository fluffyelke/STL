Mutating Algorithms
Name                         Effect
reverse()                    Reverses the order of the elements

reverse_copy()               Copies the elements while reverses order

rotate()                     Rotates the order of elements

rotate_copy()                Copies the elements while rotating their order

next_permutation()           Permutates the order of elements

prev_permutation()           Permutates the order of elements

shuffle()                    Brings the elements into the random order

random_shuffle()             Brings the elements into the random order

partition()                  Changes the order of the elements so that elements that match a criterion are at the front

stable_partition()           Same as partition() but preserves the relative order of matching and non matching elements

partition_copy()             Copies the elements while changing the order so that elements that matching a criterion are at the front
