Name                               Effects
for_each()                         Performs an operation for each element

copy()                             Copies a range starting with the first element

copy_if()                          Copies elements that match a criterion

copy_n()                           Copies n elements

copy_backward()                    Copies a range starting with the last element

move()                             Moves elements of a range starting with the first element

move_backward()                    Moves elements of a range starting with the last element

transform()                        Modifies(and copies) elements; combines elements of two ranges.

merge()                            Merge two ranges

swap_ranges()                      Swaps elements of 2 ranges

fill()                             Replaces each element with a give value

fill_n()                           Replace n elements with a given value

generate()                         Replace each element with the result of an operation

generate_n()                       Replaces n elements with the result of an operation

iota()                             Replaces each element with a sequence of incremented values

replace()                          Replaces elements that have a special value with another value

replace_if()                       Replaces elements that match a criterion with another value

replace_copy()                     Replaces elements that have a special value while copying the whole range

replace_copy_if()                  Replaces elements that match a criterion while copying the whole range
