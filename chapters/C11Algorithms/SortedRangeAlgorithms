Sorting-Range Algorithms
Name                         Effect
binary_search()              Returns whether the range contains an element

includes()                   Returns whether each element of a range is also an element of another range

lower_bound()                Finds the first element greater than or equal to a given value

upper_bound()                Finds the first element greater than a given value

equal_range()                Returns the range of elements equal to a given value

merge()                      Merges the element of two ranges

set_union()                  Process the sorted union of two ranges

set_intersection()           Process the sorted intersection of two ranges

set_difference()             Process a sorted range that contains all elements of a range that are not part of another range

set_symmetric_difference()   Process a sorted range that contains all elements that are in exactly one of two ranges.

inplace_merge()              Merges two consecutive sorted ranges

partition_point()            Returns the partitioning element for a range partitioned into elements fulfilling and elements not fulfilling a predicate
