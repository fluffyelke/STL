c.clear()                       Removes all elements(empties the container)


SPECIAL MODIFYING OPERATIONS FOR FORWARD LISTS
op - function, operation

c.merge(c2)                     Assuming that both containers contain the elements sorted, moves all elements from c2 into c so that all elements are merged and still sorted 

c.merge(c2, op)                 Assuming that both containers contain the elements sorted due to sorting criterion op(), moves all elements from c2 into c so that all elements are merged and still sorted according to op() 

c.reverse()                     Reverse the order of all elements.
